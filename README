Requires Mac OS X 10.6 or later

This tool sets the display resolution.  This tool exists so that we
can set the display to a setting when the display manager says it can't,
mainly, when a Mac starts up and the monitor is off, or if the Mac is on
a KVM.

WARNING:
In testing garbage values, I did get this to tool to change the display so that absolutely
nothing displayed.  I don't remember what I did to get that.  And I can't duplicate it anymore.
I could remotely control it, so I could fix it.  But beware, if you can't remotely control the
machine and fix bad display settings, well, you might have to resort to drastic measures to fix
a mac with bad display settings (like boot off of a different disk and delete the display
preferences.

In other words, this tool will change the display settings regardless of what the display
manager says is possible.  So be careful!!!
